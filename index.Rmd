## About Me
I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the JHU-BSPH. I am passionate about data science and statistical methodology. My primary technical interests are in autoencoders and causal inference, while my domain-specific research interests lie broadly in the fields of environmental health, climate policy, and protein design. I did my undergraduate (BSc) in Biochemistry at the University of Arizona, and spent 3-years as a research assistant focused on computational protein design and on synthetic biology. I have a little bit of experience in statistics/programming/data analysis, but no formal academic training. What I hope most to get out of this course is a more fundamental grasp of the RLang and the data science ecosystem built around it.

### Inspiring Link
While I am not a computer scientist nor doing a CS PhD, this is the video that originally inspirated me to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics: [**The Man Who Revolutionized Computer Science With Math**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao)

I love his discussion of industry at the end of the video, and how the problems he faced as an industry scientist were extremely interesting and leveraged his academic background.
